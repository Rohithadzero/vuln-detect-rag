"""Sharded map-reduce reading of retrieved context across cloud providers.

The problem this solves
----------------------

The previous orchestration asked every configured cloud provider the *same*
question with the *same* full context, then merged the answers. That costs
``N x context`` tokens to answer one question, so four providers burn four free
tiers four times as fast as one — the ensemble made rate limiting worse, not
better, and it did so while adding no new evidence, since every member read
identical text.

It also hurt accuracy. A single prompt carrying every retrieved document asks
one model to attend to all of them at once, and recall of any individual fact
degrades as the surrounding context grows — the "lost in the middle" effect.
Facts sitting in the middle documents are the ones a model is most likely to
paper over from memory.

What this does instead
----------------------

Retrieved documents are partitioned into shards and each shard is sent to a
*different* provider:

    docs 1-3  -> Groq        ─┐
    docs 4-6  -> Gemini       ├─ map: extract only what these docs support
    docs 7-9  -> OpenRouter   │
    docs 10-12-> NVIDIA      ─┘
                                    │
                                    └─> reduce: one small call merges extracts

Consequences, in the order they matter here:

1. **Rate limiting.** Each provider sees roughly ``context / N`` tokens rather
   than the whole context. Against the broadcast ensemble that is an ``N``-fold
   reduction in tokens charged to any single provider (``C`` -> ``C/N``), and
   an ``N``-fold reduction in total tokens per question (``N*C`` -> ``C``, plus
   one small reduce call). Linear in the provider count, not quadratic.

2. **Hallucination.** Each map call reads a handful of documents with one
   instruction — extract what is here, say NOTHING_RELEVANT if the answer is
   not — which is a far easier task to do faithfully than open-ended synthesis
   over a wall of text. The reduce step then never sees raw retrieved text at
   all; it only sees extracts that already carry citations, so it has less
   opportunity to invent and nothing to invent from.

3. **Latency.** Shards for different providers run concurrently.

Document numbers are assigned *globally* before sharding and preserved inside
each shard, so a ``[Doc 7]`` citation produced by whichever provider happened to
read document 7 still points at document 7 in the source list the user sees.
